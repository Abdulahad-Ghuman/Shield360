# Shield360
* Shield360 is a work-in-progress security project that offers a suite of tools designed to enhance file security and system monitoring.
* Note: This project is currently under active development.

# Features
* Directory Monitoring: Continuously monitors specified directories for any changes, alerting you to potential issues.

* Basic Antivirus with Encryption Quarantine:
Scans files for known malware and encrypts them using AES-GCM to render them unusable.

* File Encryption/Decryption: Securely encrypts and decrypts files using AES-GCM, ensuring data confidentiality.

# Planned Improvements
* Enhanced Code Refinement: Further improve code quality and security practices before moving to a production environment.

* Supervised Learning for Antivirus: Implement supervised learning techniques to improve malware detection and adapt to new threats.

* Unquarantine Option: Add functionality to safely unquarantine files rather than directly decrypting them, for more flexible file recovery.

* Botnet Protection Tool: Develop additional tools to help prevent botnets from overwhelming websites, enhancing overall network security.
